# Movies App
Project #17 in Brad Traversy's 50 Projects in 50 Days. This project is focused on building a movies app with a third party API which has a database with movies, titles, ratings. The app is also designed to have a hover effect which shows the overview of the movies, and the search functionality can be used to search for movies.
